# Pathtracer-with-Ray-Triangle-Intersection
This project is based on Kevin Beason's SmallPT pathtracer. It extends the original project by adding:
-MÃ¶ller-Trumbore ray-triangle intersection algorithm,
-.OFF file loader,
-Motion Blur in Global Shutter

In order to compile the project -> "g++ -O3 -fopenmp cgrpt1.cpp -o cgrpt"
In order to execute the program ->  e.g.: ./cgrpt 500 800 (pass additional "-withMB" argument for motion blur or pass "-withRSMB" for rolling shutter) 

Result without motion blur.(1200x800, 10K Samples)
